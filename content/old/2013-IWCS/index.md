abstract: "Logical metonymy interpretation (e.g. <i>begin the book → writing</i>) has received wide attention
in linguistics. Experimental results have shown higher processing costs for metonymic conditions
compared with non-metonymic ones (<i>read the book</i>). According to a widely held interpretation, it is
the type clash between the event-selecting verb and the entity-denoting object (<i>begin the book</i>) that
triggers coercion mechanisms and leads to additional processing effort. We propose an alternative
explanation and argue that the extra processing effort is an effect of thematic fit. This is a more
economical hypothesis that does not need to postulate a separate type clash mechanism: entity-denoting objects simply have a low fit as objects of event-selecting verbs. We test linguistic datasets
from psycholinguistic experiments and find that a structured distributional model of thematic fit,
which does not encode any explicit argument type information, is able to replicate all significant
experimental findings. This result provides evidence for a graded account of coercion phenomena in
which thematic fit accounts for both the trigger of the coercion and the retrieval of the covert event."

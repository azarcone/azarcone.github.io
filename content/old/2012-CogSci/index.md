abstract: "It has been widely acknowledged that the interpretation of logical metonymies involves the interpretation of covert events
(<i>begin the book → reading / writing</i>). Whether this implicit content is part of our lexicon or rather derives from general pragmatic inference, it is currently subject of debate. We present results from a probe recognition experiment, providing novel evidence in support of early metonymy processing, consistent with the hypothesis that covert events are retrieved from knowledge of typical events activated by lexical items."

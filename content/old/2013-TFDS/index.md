abstract: "Logical metonymy combines an event-selecting verb with an entity-denoting noun (e.g., <i>The
writer began the novel</i>), triggering a covert event interpretation (e.g., <i>reading, writing</i>). Experimental
investigations of logical metonymy must assume a binary distinction between metonymic (i.e. event-selecting) verbs and non-metonymic verbs to establish a control condition. However, this binary
distinction (whether a verb is metonymic or not) is mostly made on intuitive grounds, which introduces
a potential confounding factor.
We describe a corpus-based approach which characterizes verbs in terms of their behavior at
the syntax-semantics interface. The model assesses the extent to which transitive verbs prefer
event-denoting objects over entity-denoting objects. We then test this “eventhood” measure on
psycholinguistic datasets, showing that it can distinguish not only metonymic from non-metonymic
verbs, but that it can also capture more fine-grained distinctions among different classes of metonymic
verbs, putting such distinctions into a new graded perspective."

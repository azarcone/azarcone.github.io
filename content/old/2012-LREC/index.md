abstract: "Logical metonymies like <i>The author began the book</i> involve the interpretation of events that are not realized in the sentence (Covert events: -> <i>writing the book</i>). The Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995) provides a qualia-based account of covert event interpretation, claiming that the covert event is retrieved from the qualia structure of the object. Such a theory poses the question of to what extent covert events in logical metonymies can be accounted for by qualia structures. Building on previous work on English, we present a corpus study for German verbs (<i>anfangen (mit)</i>, <i>aufhören (mit)</i>, <i>beenden</i>, <i>beginnen (mit)</i>, <i>geniessen</i>, based on data obtained from the deWaC corpus. We built a corpus of logical metonymies, which were manually annotated and compared with the qualia structures of their objects, then we contrasted annotation results from two expert annotators for metonymies (<i>The author began the book</i>) and long forms (<i>The author began reading the book</i>) across verbs. Our annotation was evaluated on a sample of sentences annotated by a group of naive annotators on a crowdsourcing platform. The logical metonymy database (2661 metonymies and 1886 long forms) with two expert annotations is freely available for scientific research purposes."

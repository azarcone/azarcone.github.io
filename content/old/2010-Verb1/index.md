abstract: "A range of event-subcategorizing verbs can combine with entity-denoting nouns, like <i>begin the newspaper</i>. The interpretation of such sentences typically involves the recovery of covert events (CE) which are not realized on the surface, as in <i>.begin reading the newspaper</i>.. We report on an ongoing study that scrutinizes two assumptions made by
traditional accounts: (a) that the triggering of CEs can be ascribed to the object’s ontological type; and (b), that one or two CEs
can be retrieved for each noun. Preliminary evidence against both assumptions is presented."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

abstract: "Event types (ET) have been widely addressed in linguistics literature, but have
received little attention in psycholinguitics, neurolinguistics and computational
linguistics research. This thesis dissertation explores the nature of event types
from a cognitive point of view: many descriptions and diagnostics on event types
are available, but few studies have dealt with the problem of how event types are represented
and processed in the mental lexicon. An important prerequisite for this sort of
research is the building of a corpus of stimuli that meets our needs (web-based
pre-tests were run to test the reliability of the stimuli, which should be balanced
to control the variables known to affect processing costs) and an analysis of
pre-existing literature in experimental psycholinguistics of event types.
Our main concern was to explore new experimental settings in verb semantics
psycholinguistics and to adapt them to this specific type of investigation: the
choice of the method was narrowed down to the semantic priming paradigm,
although the set of stimuli could also be suitable for other experimental settings,
such as reading-time studies. The semantic priming paradigm was exploited
to contrast processing effects on achievement verbs and activity verbs, which
differ with respect to two superordinate features: durativity and resultativity. A
series of priming experiments were run to explore differences and interactions
between such features and the tense morphology and to evaluate the different
contribution of the experimental setting in the observation and measurement
of the effect: experiment 1 and experiment 2 followed a similar design and
contrasted the effects of different neutral primes; experiment 3 focused on the
interaction between event types and Italian tense morphology"

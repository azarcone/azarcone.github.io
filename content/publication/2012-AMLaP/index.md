abstract: "Logical metonymy (*The author began the book*) has often been explained in terms of a type-clash between an eventsubcategorizing
metonymic verb (*begin*) and an entity-denoting object (*book*), triggering the recovery of a covert event
(<u>*reading*</u>). Experiment 3 in Traxler, Pickering and McElree (2002) is often cited as a well-known correlate of this clash, as the
authors find a significant interaction between type of verb (metonymic vs. non-metonymic) and type of object (entitydenoting
vs. event-denoting).
Type clashes and selectional restriction violations are widely invoked in linguistic theory, but more recent work in
psycholinguistics suggests that these phenomena might be better captured via graded notions such as typicality and thematic
fit. For example, some of the materials of Traxler and colleagues’ seem to favor event-denoting items via a better thematic fit
(***The pastor*** *finished/prepared the* ***funeral*** */sandwich*).
<br />
Similarity-based frameworks such as Distributional Memory and ECU described in Lenci (2011) lend themselves particularly
well to modeling the graded effect of thematic fit and expectation about upcoming arguments in sentence processing. We
contrast three ECU-based models: <i>verb-only, sum</i> and <i>product</i>. <i>Verb-only</i> exploits expectations coming from the verb to
yield the thematic fit for a filler in a given object argument position (e.g. for <i>sandwich</i> and <i>prepare</i>); the other two models do
the same by combining expectations from subject and verb (e.g. for <i>sandwich</i> and <i><pastor, prepare></i>) by means of two
different functions (<i>sum</i> and <i>product</i>). We use the models to (1) mirror the results from Traxler and colleagues; (2) contrast
expectations coming from the verb and expectations coming from the composition of subject and verb, in order to evaluate
whether the type-clash effect might be due to a cueing effect of the subject; (3) suggest an alternative account of logical
metonymy interpretation which re-defines the binary notion of type-clash in more graded terms, i.e. as thematic fit.
The models successfully replicated the pattern of results of the psycholinguistic experiment, yielding the lowest thematic
fit for metonymic verbs combined with entity-denoting objects, and a main effect of object type (entity-denoting vs. event-denoting;
<i>**sum, ***product, ***verb-only</i>), and a significant verb-object interaction (<i>**sum, **verb-only</i>). All models
yielded a better thematic fit for event-denoting than for entity-denoting objects on the whole dataset (<i>**sum, ***product,
***verb-only</i>), for metonymic verbs (<i>***sum, **product, ***verb-only</i>), but not for non-metonymic verbs. The pattern of
results of the psycholinguistic experiment was replicated not only by models incorporating the subject (<i>sum</i> and <i>product</i>), but
also by the verb-only model, thus suggesting the measured effect is not ascribable to an effect of subject only, but is indeed
due to the verb-object interaction.
The models’ success in replicating the results from the psycholinguistic experiments shows that similarity-based models are an adequate tool to model phenomena such as selectional preferences and logical metonymy, suggesting that they can both be accounted for in terms of thematic fit."

abstract: "We aim to model the results from a self-paced reading experiment, which tested the effect of semantic type clash and typicality on the processing of German complement coercion. We present two distributional semantic models to test if they can model the effect of both type and typicality in the psycholinguistic study. We show that one of the models, without explicitly representing type information, can
account both for the effect of type and typicality in complement coercion."

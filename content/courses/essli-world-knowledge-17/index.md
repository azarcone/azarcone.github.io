<h4>Description </h4>

This is an interdisciplinary course intended to bring together students from psycholinguistic and computational backgrounds and explore the question of world-knowledge in distributional semantics through lectures on recent published research. Distributional semantics exploits cooccurrences in corpus data in order to represent semantic knowledge implicitly through statistics about word context, but the extent to which this can serve as a proxy for semantic grounding in some form of world-knowledge is still an unresolved question. What we currently understand and how to think about the boundary between distributionally-represented knowledge and explicit world-knowledge will be the main topic of the course.

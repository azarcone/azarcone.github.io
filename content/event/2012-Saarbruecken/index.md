summary: "Talk on complement coercion through the lens of the word-as-cues framework"

abstract: "Sentences like *The author began the book* (logical metonymies /
 aka coercion) combine a verb requiring an event-denoting object
 (event-subcategorizing verb, *begin*) and entity-denoting object (*book*),
 and involve the understanding of a covert event (*reading*). Type-clash
 (between entity-denoting object and event-subcategorizing verb) has been a
 classical way to account for such phenomena, and together with selectional
 restriction violations it is widely invoked in linguistic theory.

 More recent work in psycholinguistics suggests that these phenomena might
 be better captured via graded notions such as typicality and thematic fit,
 defined as the typicality of a filler for an argument slot (e.g. how
 typical it is that books are objects of *read, begin, eat*, ?). I present
 two psycholinguistic experiments showing effects of event typicality in
 logical metonymy interpretation (*the baker began the icing* - *spreading*,
 *The child began the icing* -> *eating*).

 Distributional Semantic Models are computational models of word meaning
 based on the assumption that words occurring in similar contexts (and in
 similar argument positions) are also semantically similar, and represent
 word meaning with corpus-based co-occurrence vectors. Distributional
 Memory, with its module ECU (Expectation Composition and Update), is a
 distributional semantic model of the dynamic composition and update of
 thematic fit and of the graded effect of thematic fit on expectations about
 upcoming arguments. In particular, ECU can distinguish expectations of
 upcoming arguments for different typical event scenarios (*Baker spreads
 icing* vs. *Child eats icing*).


 The second part of my talk will present first results from computational
 models such as ECU on logical metonymy, successfully replicating the
 pattern of results from the psycholinguistic experiments. Both the
 psycholinguisitic experiments and the similarity-based models suggest an
 alternative account of logical metonymy interpretation which redefines the
 binary notion of type-clash in more graded terms, i.e. as thematic fit, and
 which is compatible with words-as-cues dynamical models of the lexicon."

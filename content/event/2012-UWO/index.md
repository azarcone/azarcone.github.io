summary: Talk on the plausibility-driven interpretation of covert events.

abstract: "Sentences like The author began the book
(logical metonymies) combine a verb requiring an
event-denoting object (event-subcategorizing verb, beg in) and entity-denoting object (
book),
and involve
the understanding of a covert event (
reading
). Type
-
clash
(between entity
-
denoting object and event
-
subcategorizing verb)
has been a classical way to account for such
phenomena, and together with selection
al restriction violations it is widely invoked in
linguistic theory.
More recent work in psycholinguistics suggests that these phenomena might be better
captured via graded notions such as typicality and thematic fit,
defined as the plausibility of a
filler for an argument slot (e.g. how typical it is that books are
objects of read, begin, eat
...).
I present two psycholinguistic experiments
showing effects of event typicality in logical
metonymy interpretation
(
The baker began the icing
-
>
spreading
,
The child began the icing
-> eating).
Distributional Semantic Models are
computational models
of word meaning based on the assumption that words occurring in similar contexts (and in similar argument positions) are
also semantically similar, and
represent word
meaning with corpus
-
based co
-
occurrence
vectors. Distributional Memory, with its mod
u
l
e
ECU (
E
xpectation
C
omposition and
U
pdate),
is a distributional semantic model
of
the dynamic composition and update of
thematic
fit and
of
the graded effect of thematic
fit
on
expectation
s
about upcoming
arguments
.
In particular,
ECU can distinguish expectations of upcoming arguments for different
typical
event scenarios
(
Baker spreads icing
vs.
Child
eats icing
).
The second part of my talk will present first results fr
om
computational
models
such as ECU
on logical metonymy, successfully replicating t
he pattern of results from the
psycholinguistic
experiments. Both the psycholinguistic experiments and the similarity
-
based models
suggest
an alternative account of
logical
metonymy interpretation
redefining
the binary notion of
type
-
clash in more graded terms, i.e. as thematic fit.

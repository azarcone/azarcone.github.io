<p>Project A2 was concerned with the development of wide-coverage, automatic methods for acquiring script knowledge, thus addressing the absence of such script knowledge bases. Since script event sequences are rarely explicit in natural prose, the project used crowd-sourcing methods to create suitable corpora for script acquisition. These  then served as the input for novel script-mining algorithms which were used to induce psychologically plausible probabilistic script-automata representations.</p>

<p>Finally, distributional models were applied to determine the semantic similarity of linguistic expressions, as conditioned by script knowledge – methods that are essential for applying scripts to real texts.</p>

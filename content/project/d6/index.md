<p>Project D6 was concerned with a particular phenomenon of incremental specification in context, namely the interpretation of verb-object pairs. While some verb-object pairs are interpreted compositionally ("simple composition", as in <em>begin a holiday</em>), the understanding of others involves covert events that are not realised on the surface ("enriched composition": for example, <em>begin a song</em>, in neutral context, implies <em>begin <underline>singing</underline> a song</em>). The interpretation of such pairs involves two specification steps: (1) the decision between simple and enriched composition; (2) in enriched composition, the specification of the covert event.</p>

<p>The project used psycholinguistic and computational techniques to elucidate the as of yet neglected role of lexical-semantic context factors, which had only been described in a simplified way so far. We will investigated (a) the interpretation of borderline cases and (b) the semantic relations within the set of covert events for given verb-object pairs. Practical results included a corpus-based model and a distributional characterization of constructions with covert events.</p>

<p>Project A3 aimed at collecting formalized knowledge about prototypical sequences of events – script knowledge – from data, and using it to improve algorithms for natural language processing and our understanding of linguistic encoding choice and interpretation in human communication. The project will developed methods for learning scripts with wide coverage from unannotated texts and extend the representations of script events with information about their preconditions and effects to keep track of causal connections between events.</p>
<p>
These deeper and wider-coverage script models were be applied to various natural language processing tasks, and used to model pragmatic interpretations; we used and extended the Rational Speech Act (RSA) model as a framework for modelling pragmatic inferences and explored how the RSA model can be related to existing notions used in the SFB, specifically the UID hypothesis.</p>

summary: Invited talk for one of the weekly seminar at CLASP, University of Gothenburg.

abstract: "The recent advancements in language modeling and conversational AI have been accompanied by the promise of a dramatic impact on the adoption of language technologies. Small and medium businesses are not immune to this hype, but often (1) lack the in-house expertise to develop user-centered design and (2) do not have enough (representative) data for training their machine learning modules, nor resources to collect it.<br />
<br />
The NLP community has cared about data “before it was cool”. However, in the broader and more variegated community of ML/AI practitioners, the most relevant aspects of data are size of training data and the popularity of benchmark datasets (<i>the Kaggle game</i>, Manning 2015). Users are also not typically part of the picture, and even less so are crowdworkers, whose humanity is hidden inside a metaphorical <i>mechanical Turk</i>. A scarce attention to data and users thus also has ethical consequences on how data is obtained and what data is used for.<br />
<br />
I will present some recent work in conversational AI which is largely motivated by the need for a more user- and data-centered perspective. I argue that this perspective is a missing link when transferring technologies outside academia and into industrial use cases.</br>
